# object - Base Object Source Code #

This directory contains the most generic objects in the GameObject hierarchy.
Most of these are abstract enough to not appear in the game directly, most
don't even have features to make them for a particular game.

I am using a naming convention "_Object". Most of them should have the word
object in their name and I am trying to keep their first letter different
for autocompletion. Widget is an exception because that name is already pretty
standard, what's a ScreenObject?

And now I am second guessing again.

+   GameObject3D/WorldObject
