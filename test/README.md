# Test Directory #

Testing is done with Catch. The single header is in this directory.
(Retrived 2016/05/18 15:25 - v1.5.4)

The reason the Catch header is not included is it is quite large and not
actually part of my project.

This directory (and any notes on it) will be undergoing many changes as I
figure out how to use the Catch system.
